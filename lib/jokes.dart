Maybe you'll luck out and catch yourself a big one!\" \nDetermined, the blonde turned and headed for the swamps, set on catching herself an alligator. \nLater in the day, the shopkeeper was driving home, when he spotted the young woman standing waist deep in the water, shotgun in hand. Just then, he saw a huge 9-foot alligator swimming quickly toward her. She took aim, killed the creature, and with a great deal of effort hauled it on to the swamp bank. \nLying nearby were several more of the dead creatures. The shopkeeper watched in amazement. Just then the blonde flipped the alligator on its back, and frustrated, shouted out, \"Damn it, this one isn't wearing any shoes either!\"",

        "Three blondes were all vying for the last available position on the local police force. The detective conducting the interview looked at the three of them and said, \"So you all want to be a cop, eh?\"The blondes all nodded. The detective got up, opened a file drawer and pulled out a file folder. Sitting back down, he opened it up and withdrew a photograph, and said, \"To be a detect, you have to be able to DETECT. You must be able to notice things such as distinguishing features and oddities such as scars, etc.\" So saying, he stuck the photo in the face of the first blonde and withdrew it after about 2 seconds. \"Now, he said, \"Did you notice any distinguishing features about this man?\"The blonde immediately said, \"Yes, I did. He only has one eye!\"The detective shook his head and said, \"Of COURSE he only has one eye in this picture! It's a PROFILE of his face! You're dismissed!\"The first blonde hung her head and walked out of the office. The detective then turned to the second blonde, stuck the photo in her face for two seconds, pulled it back and said, \"What about you? Notice anything unusual or outstanding about this man?\"The blonde immediately shot back, \"Yep! He only has one ear!\"The detective put his head in his hand and exclaimed, \"Didn't you hear what I just said to the other lady? This is a PROFILE of the man's face! Of COURSE you can only see one ear!! You're excused, too! You'd never make a good detective!\"The second blonde sheepishly walked out of the office.The detective turn his attention to the last blonde and said, \"This is probably a waste of time, but....\". He flashed the photo in her face for a couple of seconds and withdrew it, saying, \"Alright. Did YOU notice anything distinguishing or unusual about this man?\"The blonde said, \"Yes, I did. This man wears contact lenses.\"The detective frowned, took another look at the picture and began looking at some of the papers in the folder. He looked up at the blonde with a puzzled expression and said, \"You're absolutely right! His bio says he wears contacts! How in the world could tell that by looking at this picture?\"The blonde rolled her eyes and said, \"DUH! He has only one eye and one ear, he certainly CAN'T WEAR GLASSES!\"",

        "One day two blondes each bought a pig.  The problem they were having was telling the two pigs apart.  So, the first blonde had an idea: She said, \"I'll cut my pig's tail off, then we will know the difference.\" So she cut her pig's tail off.  That night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig's tail off.  The next morning the blonde had a solution, she said,\"I'll just cut my pig's right back leg off.\" So, she did.  That night same thing; the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig's right back leg off.  The next morning the blondes were real upset and finally decided to cut the back left leg from the pig, so she did.  That night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig's back left leg off.  The next morning the blondes were really upset and didn't know how they were going to tell their pigs apart.  So, one of them stated, \"I will cut my pig's right front leg off. Then we can tell our pigs apart.\" So, she did.  That night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig's right front leg off.  The blondes were really upset and decided the only logical explanation would be to cut the remaining leg off one pig. So, they did.  That night the pigs got in a fight and one pig bit the other pig's only leg off.  The next morning when the blondes awoke they were devastated.  Finally, the other blonde spoke up and said,  \"How about you take the white one and I'll take the black one.\"",
